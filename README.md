# Libft

### Description:

Create your own library: a collection of functions that will serve as a useful tool throughout your cursus.

### Technical considerations:
- Declaring global variables is strictly forbidden.
- If you need helper functions to break down a more complex function, define them as `static` functions to restrict their scope to the appropriate file.
- You must use the ar command to create your library. The use of libtool is strictly forbidden.
- Your libft.a must be created at the root of your repository.

### Learning process:

Key things learned from this project:

- String manipulation.
- Memory management.
- Linked lists.
- Header files.
- Static libraries.
- Makefiles.
- Testing (using external tools, edge cases, strict testing).

### Testing:

- My own [testfiles](/test_libft).

- war-machine, libftTester, libft-unit-test, fsoares. See [Francinette](https://github.com/WaRtr0/francinette-image).
